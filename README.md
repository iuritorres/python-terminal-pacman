# Python Terminal Pacman

## Usage

- Clone this repository on your local machine
- Open your terminal in project root and type:

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
pip install -r .\requirements.txt

python src/game.py
```

PS.: Make sure you're running you virtual environment with python `3.11` or higher, because this project uses some python built-in modules like `enum.StrEnum` that doesn't have support for older versions.
